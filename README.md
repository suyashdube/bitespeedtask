Built on MVC architecture using typescript. Used postgres for database. Made pool connection with neonDB. Neon allows you to branch your Postgres database to support modern development workflows instantly. You can create branches for test environments for every CI/CD pipeline deployment. Used sql query to construct data table in the database.
